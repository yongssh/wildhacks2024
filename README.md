**Productivity Track**
As college students, we’re all barely hanging in there. But studying is always better with friends!
So, for WildHacks 2024, we created bearly.study
- Join a chat room with your friends
- Set a timer for whatever current task you’re working on

Because when you’re studying with friends, 
it **bear-ly** feels like you’re studying

Created with React, Next.JS, Socket.io, etc.
